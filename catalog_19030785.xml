			        <review>This song is good with lyrics.The songâ€™s sound being powerfully mystifying, a search of musical spirituality.It was about going through,through this land.This mythical because that's what I like to do is write a lot of mythical scenes.You know, like the history of the wars on Neptune.</review>

			        <review>This song is good. This song touched the heart of the people. This song is written on the reaction to the spetember 11 attack in the United State, written in the form of question. Jackson desired to write a song capturing the emotion surrounding the attacks. This song recived largely positive reviews from the crities, who appreciated its sipmle largly apolitical stance. </review>
